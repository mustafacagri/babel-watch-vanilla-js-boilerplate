# Babel Vanilla JS Boilerplate

We are using babel and watch packages to develop our project

##Â Usage

```npm init```

Then,

```npm run watch```

Now, we are watching the changes and moving ES5 JS files to dist folder. That's all.

## Index.html

You may have a look dist/index.html to see what's going on. First of all, there will be no index.js file in src and dist folders. After you run the "npm run watch" they will be created automatically.
